Rock Paper Scissor Game
1/18/2021

This project was a challenge. I had to create a rock, paper, scissor, game with javascript. I had to research 'else if' statements. I am still having trouble with getting a random variable from my array. I am hoping that I will be able to figure it out with more knowledge going forward in the course. I plan on coming back to this project to continue to finesse it and add media and an HTML file that will display the game.
